# Crabjs Coding Standards

This repository includes the [Crab.js](http://crabjs.com) coding standard definition for [Javascript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) along with a few other helpful resources. The Guide standard will never be 100% accurate, but should be viewed as a strong set of guidelines while writing software for Crabjs.
